      <h2 class="text-h2 mt-8 mb-2">What are technographics and your ICP</h2>

      <p>
        If you're part of a mature go-to-market organization, you likely have a
        good handle on your Ideal Customer Profile ("ICP"), as it's
        traditionally defined. You appreciate how much a well-defined ICP
        affects sales efficiency. However, there is a blind spot in the ICP
        development process that many orgs have yet to build out. Most
        go-to-market (GTM) teams have some intuition as to what technology
        stacks are predictive of successfully closed deals or leads that are
        unlikely to close, but they don't have data to support these intuitions
        and have no way of acquiring or analyzing this data at any real scale.

      <p>
        If a GTM organization knew exactly which technologies were in the "sweet
        spot" in terms of making a closed deal likely and which would make a
        deal impossible, would it improve their efficiency through better
        prioritization of leads? Would augmenting their ICP with this data
        improve the efficiency of marketing? We think so.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to close a greater number of deals more efficiently, sales and
        marketing teams ought to refine their ICP in this way. This is where
        Wappalyzer's technographics can help.

      <h2 class="text-h2 mt-8 mb-2">
        Refined ICP &rarr; more accurate lead scoring &rarr; more sales in less
        time
      </h2>

      <p>
        By integrating Wappalyzer with a CRM or Marketing Automation Platform
        ("MAP"), teams will be able enrich all account data (customers,
        prospects, lost deals) with technographics. From there, teams can create
        reports directly in their CRMs or MAPs to identify patterns in the tech
        stacks of both their customers and their lost deals. They would also be
        able see how these answers might differ across other ICP variables like
        scale, industry, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        Almost every software company will find meaningful signal in these
        reports. What can be done with this information?
      </p>

      <ol class="mb-4">
        <li>Enhanced view of ICP will refine lead scoring algorithms</li>
        <li>
          Salespeople will have leads that are easier to prioritize with a
          higher probability of success
        </li>
        <li>
          Teams can avoid the dreaded time-wasting interactions that drag on for
          months only to end up with an implementation engineer saying "this is
          not going to work"
        </li>
        <li>Marketing content can be more targeted and relevant</li>
        <li>
          Salespeople will have the ability to deliver personalized,
          differentiated messages, e.g. '<em
            >We see that you're using technology ABC; we have a great
            integration with lots of customers that also use it and here are two
            relevant case studies</em
          >'.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Leveraging tech stack data to inform outreach will save time and money.
        For example, teams can use this information to tailor marketing
        campaigns specifically to the technology their prospects are using,
        improving interaction rates with outbound messages and ads.
      </p>

      <p>Using this approach will allow teams to:</p>

      <ul class="mb-4">
        <li>
          Personalize their emails more effectively – Send out emails that go
          beyond "hey, here's what we do" by referencing specific technologies
          used by their leads and customers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Save time on manual research - no need for tedious one-by-one research
          into prospect companies' systems or software platforms.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-h2 mt-8 mb-2">
        Tech Stack Data Can Help You Build Better Prospecting Lists
      </h2>

      <p>
        After establishing technographics as part of ICP development, and
        successfully using that data to improve the efficiency of an existing
        sales pipeline, technographics can also be used to improve lead
        generation and expand the top of the funnel.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, SDRs can create lists of companies that use the
        technologies of their company’s top integration partners. They can
        create lists of prospects that are already using a top competitor and
        avoid reaching out to them (if they are in a low-churn,
        high-switching-cost market). Account executives at Mixpanel, for
        example, may choose to avoid reaching out to companies that they already
        know are using Amplitude, and vice versa.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h2 mt-8 mb-2">Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        If you're reading this, chances are that you already know how important
        tech stack data can be for your GTM organization. However, the fact
        remains that most businesses have not yet found a way to generate these
        insights at scale. We hope we've given you a better understanding of why
        tech stack data is so valuable and how it can help improve your GTM
        organization's velocity and efficiency. If nothing else, we hope this
        post has given some food for thought! Please feel free to reach out with
