          >over 200 apps per department</a

        analytics, communication, research, and data management functions. So
        when teams are looking for a new platform to add to their tech stack,
        it's a much easier sell if it integrates seamlessly with the tools they
        already use.

        Five ways to use Wappalyzer with HubSpot to improve sales and marketing
        conversions

      <h3 class="text-h3 mb-2">
        1. See what technology your leads are using, and enrich lead data for
        better targeting

          >Wappalyzer app in HubSpot</a
        >, you can see your leads' tech stacks right in the CRM, right alongside
        other contact data like company size and contact information.
      </p>

      <p>
        This extra company information helps sales teams target leads based on
        what technology they use. For example, sales reps can find companies
        that are using a specific ecommerce platform or payment processor and
        share information about how they can work with your software.

      <h3 class="text-h3 mt-8 mb-2">
        2. Tailor messaging in outbound emails with relevant tech stack info and
        actionable ideas
      </h3>

      <p>
        When creating outbound email campaigns or marketing nurturing workflows,
        you can incorporate information from Wappalyzer for more tailored
        messaging and helpful educational content. For example, if you're
        building a series of emails about using marketing intelligence tools to
        build smarter reports, you can create emails for each specific platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        Customized marketing and sales content with more relevant messaging is
        more effective and likely to lead to a deal.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-h3 mt-8 mb-2">
        3. Target specific audiences in your database by the tech they use
      </h3>

      <p>
        Find new, engaged leads with the tech information from Wappalyzer in the
        HubSpot CRM. Search for specific audiences based on the technology they
        use, then create targeted ad campaigns, email outreach sequences,
        events, or follow-up messages for groups of app users.
      </p>

      <p>
        After running these targeted campaigns to different audiences, analyze
        performance to see if certain audiences are converting more than others.
        This can help you improve close rates and reduce cost per conversion in
        ads.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-h3 mt-8 mb-2">
        4. Find new channels for marketing based on popular apps among your
        target audience

        reads, "It's a great way to find potential leads for my marketing
        agency." Marketing agencies can target clients using software that they
        support, like web design agencies, web developers, or SEO experts. Or,
        marketers can find new ad opportunities, like the newsletter of an app
        their entire audience is using.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-h3 mt-8 mb-2">
        5. Discover new leads with email and contact information on new
        prospects
      </h3>

      <p>
        As sales reps conduct prospect research, they can instantly access
        contact information like email addresses and social media profiles for
        potential leads. The Wappalyzer integration with HubSpot shows contact
        information, company information, social media profiles, and contact
        activities all in one place, making it easy to conduct sales research
        more quickly.

        Use enhanced prospect data for more effective marketing and sales
        outreach
      </h3>

      <p>
        Wappalyzer and HubSpot make the marketing and sales process less of a
        mystery. Rather than using educated guesses to learn what related apps
        and tools your audience uses, we provide real, actionable data.
