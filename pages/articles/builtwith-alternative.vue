              Looking for a BuiltWith alternative? Wappalyzer is cheaper and

          <p>
            Wappalyzer and BuiltWith are technology profilers that provide tools
            for lead generation, market research and business intelligence. The
            two companies share common background: both are Australian-based and
            founded at around the same time (2007-2008).
          </p>

          <p>
            The commonalities don't end there. With either provider, you can:

          <h3 class="text-h3 mt-8 mb-2">Data accuracy</h3>

          <p>
            Consistent customer feedback confirms that Wappalyzer is the most
            accurate technology profiler. Wappalyzer's data is updated daily,
            ensuring only actively visited websites are included in technology
            lookups and lead lists. The focus is on quality, not quantity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every website tracked by Wappalyzer is reverified at least once a
            month. BuiltWith apears to do this roughly once a quarter, often
            including stale data in reports.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thanks to an active community of developers, Wappalyzer's
            crowd-sourced technology fingerprints are constantly reviewed and
            improved and technologies are added daily.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-h3 mt-8 mb-2">Methodology</h3>

          <p>
            Wappalyzer's data is largely sourced from a
            <nuxt-link to="/apps/">browser extension</nuxt-link>, supplemented
            by in-house crawlers. The browser extension is used by 2M users on a
            daily basis (many times more than BuiltWith), providing a large
            sample size to measure website traffic and track live websites. This
            method allows scanning of pages that crawlers typically can't reach,
            such as shopping carts, checkouts and sections behind a login.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-h2 mt-8 mb-2">BuiltWith pricing</h2>

          <p>
            BuiltWith charges a high, fixed monthly price, starting at $295 for
            the Basic plan, limiting access to only two technologies. To unlock
            all features you have to sign up for the $495 Pro plan, or the $995
            Team plan if you require more than one login.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-h2 mt-8 mb-2">Wappalyzer pricing</h2>

          <p>
            Wappalyzer offers two pricing models using a transparent,
            credit-based system. Subscribe to a plan to get monthly credits at a
            lower rate, free lists and extra logins for your team members. Or,
            sign up for a free account and buy credits as needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Credits can be spent on any product, including lead lists,
            technology lookups and APIs.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-8">
            Wappalyzer's $149 Starter plan is fully featured. Its mid-tier plan
            is cheaper than BuiltWith's entry-tier plan and includes multiple
            logins. Discounted plans are available for startups, students and
            nonprofits.
